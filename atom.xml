        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my hello world! Just for my personal notes, I thought it would be useful to describe how I created this blog. I have fairly limited web development experience and figured creating a blog would be a fun way to improve (the benefit of having a website is also nice!).</p>
<p>My development environment for this blog was Windows 10, working with node. I used the
<a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> scaffolding tool to launch this <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/generator-simple-static-blog#readme">generator</a> written by
Matthew Daly. The generator made it fairly easy to spin up this blog. My workflow was something like editing files in <a href="atom.io">atom</a>, and then keeping <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> (minimalist GNU) running in the background to switch between grunt and git commands. Writing posts is easy with markdown. </p>
