This is my hello world! Just for my personal notes, I thought it would be useful to describe how I created this blog. I have fairly limited web development experience and figured creating a blog would be a fun way to improve (the benefit of having a website is also nice!).


My development environment for this blog was Windows 10, working with node. I used the
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) scaffolding tool to launch this [generator](https://github.com/matthewbdaly/generator-simple-static-blog#readme) written by
Matthew Daly. The generator made it fairly easy to spin up this blog. My workflow was something like editing files in [atom](atom.io), and then keeping [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) (minimalist GNU) running in the background to switch between grunt and git commands.
